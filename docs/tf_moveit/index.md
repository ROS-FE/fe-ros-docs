# Introduction

Welcome to the part of the workshop where you will learn how to work with frame transformations and trajectory planning.

![Aww snap! There should be an image here!](images/example_transformation.png "Transformations between a robot, a bottle and a camera.")


At the end of this day you will be able to do the following:

* Write the relations between coordinate frames in a URDF file
* Publish custom transformation either from a Python script or command line
* Get the transformation between two arbitrary transforms
* Understand the relation between joint state publisher and robot state publisher
* Use Rviz to visualize the robot and the coordinate frames
* Use Rviz to plan a trajectory that brings the robot from one configuration to another whilst avoiding collisions
* Use the MoveIt API to plan and execute robot trajectories
* Write a tool to save the current robot state - used for programming robot motions
